The optimization process follows these steps:

1. **User Input**: The user provides task description, base instruction, and configuration
2. **API Processing**: The backend processes the request and prepares for optimization
3. **LLM Interaction**: The system interacts with the selected LLM (Gemini/GPT-4)
4. **Optimization Loop**: Multiple rounds of mutation and refinement occur
5. **Result Generation**: The optimized prompt is generated and returned
6. **UI Display**: Results are displayed to the user with evaluation metrics

## System Architecture üèóÔ∏è

The PromptWizard UI system consists of three main components:

1. **Frontend (Next.js)**: Provides the user interface for configuring and running prompt optimizations
2. **Backend API (Flask)**: Handles requests from the frontend and communicates with the PromptWizard core
3. **PromptWizard Core**: Microsoft's optimization engine that performs the actual prompt optimization

### Data Flow Diagram

## Integration with Microsoft PromptWizard üîÑ

This UI is built on top of Microsoft's PromptWizard framework, providing a user-friendly interface for prompt optimization. It leverages the powerful core functionality of PromptWizard while making it accessible to users without coding experience.

### What Microsoft PromptWizard Provides:
- Core prompt optimization algorithms
- Training and evaluation logic
- Dataset handling capabilities

### What Our UI Adds:
- Intuitive tabbed interface
- Visual configuration of parameters
- One-click optimization
- Export and sharing capabilities
- Quick testing with pre-configured values
- Simplified deployment options

## How PromptWizard Works üîç
- Using the problem description and initial prompt instruction, PW generates variations of the instruction by prompting LLMs to mutate it. Based on performance, the best prompt is selected. PW incorporates a critique component that provides feedback, thus guiding and refining the prompt over multiple iterations.
- PW also optimizes in-context examples. PW selects a diverse set of examples
from the training data, identifying positive and negative examples based on their performance with
the modified prompt. Negative examples help inform further prompt refinements.
- Examples and instructions are sequentially optimized, using the critique to generate synthetic examples that address the current prompt‚Äôs weaknesses. These examples are integrated to further refine the prompt.
- PW generates detailed reasoning chains via Chain-of-Thought (CoT), enriching the prompt‚Äôs capacity for problem-solving.
- PW aligns prompts with human reasoning by integrating task intent and expert
personas, enhancing both model performance and interpretability.

## Configurations ‚öôÔ∏è

Here we define the various hyperparameters used in prompt optimization process found in [promptopt_config.yaml](demos/gsm8k/configs/promptopt_config.yaml)

- ```mutate_refine_iterations```: Number of iterations for conducting mutation of task description
 followed by refinement of instructions
- ```mutation_rounds```: Number of rounds of mutation to be performed when generating different styles
- ```refine_task_eg_iterations```: Number of iterations for refining task description and in context examples
- ```style_variation```: Number of thinking style variations to be used in prompt mutation
- ```questions_batch_size```: Number of questions to be asked to LLM in a single batch, during training step
- ```min_correct_count```: Minimum number of batches of questions to correctly answered, for a prompt to be considered as performing good
- ```max_eval_batches```: Maximum number of mini-batches on which we should evaluate the prompt
- ```top_n```: Number of top best prompts to be considered from scoring stage for the next stage
- ```seen_set_size```: Number of samples from trainset to be used for training
- ```few_shot_count```: Number of in-context examples required in final prompt

## Best Practices üí°

Following are some of best pracitices we followed during are experiments
- Regarding the parameters in [promptopt_config.yaml](demos/gsm8k/configs/promptopt_config.yaml)
    - We found the best performing values for ```mutate_refine_iterations```,```mutation_rounds```,```refine_task_eg_iterations``` to be 3 or 5
    - Other parameters have been set to their ideal values. ```seen_set_size``` can be increased to 50 and ```few_shot_count``` can be set based on the use case
- The prompts generated at the end of the training process are usually very detailed, however user supervision can help tune it further for the task at hand
- Trying both configurations of having synthetic in-context examples or in-context examples from the train set can be tried to find the best prompt based on use case.
- When using the Web UI, the "Test Values" button provides a good starting point with pre-configured values for image generation prompts

## Results üìà

<p align="center">
  <img src= "./images/curve.png" width="45%" />
  <p align="center">PromptWizard consistently outperforms other methods across various
thresholds, maintaining the highest p(œÑ) values, indicating that it consistently performs near the best
possible accuracy across all tasks</p>
</p>

- The fiqure shows the performance profile curve for the instruction induction
tasks. The performance profile curve visualizes how frequently
different approaches‚Äô performance is within a given distance of the best performance. In this curve,
the x-axis (œÑ) represents the performance ratio relative to the best-performing method, and the y-axis
(p(œÑ )) reflects the fraction of tasks where a method‚Äôs performance is within this ratio. So for a given
method, the curve tells what percentage of the tasks are within œÑ distance to the best performance.
